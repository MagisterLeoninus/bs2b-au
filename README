BS2B AudioUnit wrapper for use with OS X host applications.

To build, you should have a source tree named CoreAudio under Preferences -> Locations -> Source Trees which points to the CoreAudio directory from the Xcode Audio Tools.

A big thank you to Fred Ghilini [1] for explaining the necessary Xcode project settings!
